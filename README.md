# Maintaining user rights
Remove certain role from a user:
```sql
REVOKE myRole FROM myUser
```
Removing user from database
```sql
DROP OWNED BY myUser;

```

Grant some specific role to a user
```sql
GRANT myRole TO myUser;
```

Create new user with login option
```sql
CREATE USER myUser WITH LOGIN;
```

Create schema for a user
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA "my.username"  AUTHORIZATION "my.surname";

Grant usage for a schema. This grants rights to see tables under that schema.
```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA someSchema TO myUser;

Grant select on all tables
```sql
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA mySchema TO myRole/myUser ;
